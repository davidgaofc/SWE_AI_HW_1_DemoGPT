# DemoGPT Research Paper Parser

## Description
This project is a demonstration of using DemoGPT to parse research papers and find areas of future research and related research directions that have not been explored extensively. Additionally, it suggests other papers for reference.

Given a research paper in the form of a PDF, the tool will:
- Parse through the text of the research paper.
- Identify and list down areas of future research mentioned in the paper.
- Highlight any related research directions that appear promising but haven't been extensively explored.
- Provide references to other papers if they can be helpful.

If there is an error in uploading the file, users can alternatively copy and paste the text of the research paper into the input.

**Note**: This project is a homework assignment for a class and is only intended as a demo.

## How to Use
1. Upload your research paper in PDF format.
2. Wait for the tool to process and analyze the content.
3. Review the extracted areas of future research and related directions.
4. In case of any upload errors, copy and paste the text of the research paper into the provided input box.
